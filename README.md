Hello, my name is Yvonna de SAYNA. SAYNA is a digilate school for learning the digital professions and we have family values, games and challenges.
I'm interested in code but I'm not a developer. I'm learning a lot about development. 
I'm looking to collaborate on various projects with different methods all over the world.
You can contact me by email at "yvonnahr@gmail.com"
